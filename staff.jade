          p My name is Anna Tilsen–Mogeni and I have been dancing Tap, Jazz, and Musical Theater since the age of 5, and teaching since I was 15. I think I have the Greatest Job in the world! That is why I started Dance–N–Magic, to be able to share my passion in an educational, family friendly environment.
          p Although I am originally from St. Paul, Minnesota; I went to college in Santa Rosa, CA to receive my dance certification with a teaching emphasis. It was there that I had the opportunity to study Hip Hop in depth while dancing with Fusion 415, which was a Hip Hop crew comprised of accomplished dancers who performed with many artists, including Janet Jackson. I love dancing so much, that I still perform and compete on adult dance teams. Teaching Dancercise Kids is one of my specialties. I have taught it in mobile programing around the Twin Cities under the direction of Tessa Pfeifer, the creator of this original curriculum, music, and teaching method. I have also been a lead teacher, event coordinator, curriculum developer, competition instructor, and teacher trainer for Dance Studios in the Twin Cities, until I had the wonderful opportunity to build my own, Dance–N–Magic. My husband, Cliff, and I have 2 kids. Our daughter, Kyah, is 12 yrs. old and our son, Joshua, is 7 yrs. old. As a family, we look forward to bike riding, running or walking, traveling, reading, watching movies, and spending time together.

          p My name is Miss Maria and I have been dancing since the age of 3. I started out in ballet, jazz and tap classes. I fell in love with ballet so I began to intensely study ballet 6 days a week. I studied with the Des Moines Ballet Company under the direction of Stephen Laurent and Martha Fasai. I have had the wonderful opportunity to dance in incredible roles in Nutcracker, Cinderella, Copellia, Swan Lake and Four Sisters.
          p  have had the honor to train with amazing teachers at Milwaukee Ballet Company: Jeanette Marvoka, Larry Long, and Basil Thompson. Also, I was blessed to train with David Howard at Steps, various instructors at Alvin Ailey Dance Center and Broadway Dance Center in NYC. I have been teaching ballet, Pointe, jazz, lyrical and tap dance for the past 13 years around the Twin Cities area. Along with dancing, I have done freelance artwork for Concord Jazz Label, Color Wheel Art Gallery, Courage Center, dance studios and Dance apparel shops. I am looking forward to working with Diversity Alive Theater Group. I am looking forward to learning new dance styles, new faces and growing with the Exciting–Amazing–New DANCE–n–MAGIC!!!!!

          p I moved to Saint Paul, MN when I was 10 months from Hammond IN. I’ve been dancing for 7 years, I graduated from Saint Paul Conservatory for Performing Artist. I am self taught, I taught myself Hip Hop dance by just watching dance movies and YouTube videos. That’s when I discovered my love and passion for dance so I continued my journey by going to an performing arts school, where I also was trainned in Ballet, Jazz, Hip-Hop, Tap, Modern, Afro-Modern and West African. My dream goal is to become a TV star dancing in dance movies and commercial work. Being an instructor at Dance-N-Magic is a great way to pass on my knowledge and love for dance to my fellow students.

          p I have been dancing since I could walk, driving my parents insane and they decided to put me into real dance classes. I have trained at dance studios in the Twin Cities and Broadway Dance Center in New York City. I have had the privilege of working with some amazing dancers and choreographers such as Luam, Shane Sparks, Brian Friedman, Mia Michaels, Wade Robson, Courtney Miller Jr., and many others.
